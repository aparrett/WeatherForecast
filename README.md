# WeatherForecast

This is a simple application that allows you to view the weather forecast for multiple cities to compare them.  When you search for a city, you will see a map of the city along with relative and average temperatures, pressures, and humidities.  The app currently only works with US cities.  You can view WeatherForecast at [https://ap-react-weather.herokuapp.com/](https://ap-react-weather.herokuapp.com/).

This sample weather application is the 3rd application you build in the [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) course taught by Stephen Grider.
